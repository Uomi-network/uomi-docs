# IPFS

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) serves as the decentralized file system for the UOMI blockchain. It is an integral component of the platform, enabling seamless storage and retrieval of files required for the execution of AI operations.

* **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS ensures that files are stored in a distributed network, eliminating single points of failure and improving data availability.
* **Efficient File Access**: AI agents require access to various files, including models and data inputs, to perform their computations. IPFS provides a robust mechanism to store and retrieve these files securely.
* **Integration with UOMI**: The UOMI blockchain integrates IPFS to handle files referenced by smart contracts and agents, ensuring that essential data is accessible and verifiable throughout the network.

IPFS acts as the backbone for managing the data lifecycle of AI models and inputs used by agents. By leveraging IPFS, the UOMI blockchain ensures seamless access to files for computations while maintaining their immutability to preserve data integrity. Additionally, the distributed nature of IPFS optimizes performance by efficiently spreading data across the network.
