# Agents

Agents are a core concept within the UOMI blockchain, representing autonomous entities that perform operations directly on the network. These agents are designed to leverage AI models to process data, execute computations, and interact with the blockchain ecosystem seamlessly. By integrating intelligent behavior with decentralized technology, agents become powerful tools capable of executing complex tasks efficiently.

An agent’s role extends beyond computation. It has the capability to trigger transactions on the blockchain, enabling it to manage digital assets, interact with smart contracts, and coordinate activities within the decentralized environment. This level of autonomy allows agents to operate as independent entities, driving the execution of on-chain operations without requiring constant human intervention.

Agents are tightly integrated into the UOMI infrastructure, functioning as the active participants that bridge AI capabilities with blockchain processes. They embody the intelligence of the network, processing inputs deterministically to ensure consistency across all nodes. By combining autonomy, intelligence, and decentralization, agents play a pivotal role in realizing UOMI’s vision of an AI-powered blockchain ecosystem.
