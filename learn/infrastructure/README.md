# Infrastructure

The **UOMI** infrastructure is the backbone of our platform, designed to support the seamless integration of AI-driven agents within a decentralized blockchain environment. This section provides an overview of the key components that power UOMI, enabling robust, secure, and efficient operations for AI models and agents.

Explore how **Nodes** execute AI computations, delve into the various **Models** utilized—ranging from large language models (LLMs) to image generation frameworks—and discover how **IPFS** facilitates decentralized storage. Additionally, learn about the role of **Agents** in driving autonomous, intelligent economic interactions across the UOMI ecosystem.

## Key Participants

The success of the UOMI platform relies on the contributions of several key participants:

* **Developer**: The individual responsible for developing and deploying AI-AGENTS, bringing intelligence and functionality to the platform.
* **Staker**: Provides the hardware required to run the blockchain nodes, ensuring the stability and performance of the network.
* **Delegator/Nominator**: Supplies tokens to support and secure **Staker**, helping to maintain the network’s integrity.
* **User**: Uses the blockchain to run AI-AGENTS, benefiting from the decentralized, AI-powered services that UOMI enables.

Together, these participants contribute to building a robust, scalable, and interoperable ecosystem that pushes the boundaries of decentralized AI applications.
