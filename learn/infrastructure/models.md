# Models

### Overview

AI Models are a fundamental component of the UOMI blockchain infrastructure, enabling the execution of complex operations that power the entire ecosystem. These models encompass a wide variety of architectures supporting different tasks, including:

* Natural language processing
* Image generation
* Data analysis
* Other AI-driven applications

### Integration and Features

The direct integration of AI models into the chain's infrastructure provides a seamless platform for autonomous and intelligent computations. Key features include:

* **Open Source**: The models used within the UOMI ecosystem are primarily open-source, ensuring transparency and adaptability.
* **Deterministic Execution**: To maintain consistency across the network, models are managed deterministically, ensuring that every node:
  * Processes the same input data
  * Produces identical outputs
* **Guaranteed Reliability**: This approach ensures reliability and trust in the operations performed by agents.

### Role in the Ecosystem

AI models in UOMI are responsible for driving the intelligence behind agent interactions. Their role includes:

* Processing input data
* Generating meaningful outputs
* Performing necessary computations for on-chain operations

This tight integration between AI and blockchain creates a robust environment where autonomous agents can operate effectively, leveraging the power of advanced AI technologies across diverse use cases.
