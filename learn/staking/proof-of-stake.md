# Proof of stake

## Proof of Stake Consensus

### Overview

UOMI blockchain implements a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism utilizing BABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension) for block production. This consensus mechanism provides a secure, energy-efficient, and scalable foundation for the network.

### How It Works

#### Stake-Based Validation

* Validators are selected based on their UOMI token stake in the network
* Higher stakes increase the probability of being chosen to produce blocks
* Participants must meet minimum staking requirements to become validators

#### BABE Block Production

* Utilizes a slot-based block production system
* Random validator selection for each slot using VRF (Verifiable Random Function)
* Ensures predictable block times while maintaining security
* Prevents manipulation through deterministic selection process

### Network Security

#### Economic Security

* Validators must stake tokens as collateral
* Malicious behavior results in stake slashing
* Economic incentives align validator interests with network health

### Benefits

#### Efficiency

* Significantly lower energy consumption compared to Proof of Work
* Faster transaction finality
* Reduced hardware requirements for participation

#### Scalability

* Supports high transaction throughput
* Flexible validator set size
* Efficient block production and validation process

#### Decentralization

* Encourages broad participation through staking
* Democratic validator selection process
* Reduced barriers to entry compared to mining

### Participation

#### Becoming a Validator

* Meet minimum stake requirements
* Run validator node infrastructure
* Maintain high uptime and performance
* Follow network protocols and updates

#### Staking as a Delegate

* Participate in network security without running infrastructure
* Delegate tokens to trusted validators
* Earn proportional rewards from validation activities

This consensus mechanism forms the foundation of UOMI's reliable and efficient blockchain infrastructure, enabling secure operation of AI models and agent interactions while maintaining network decentralization.
