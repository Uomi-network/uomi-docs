# Set your identity

When you are a validator, you care for your credibility and recognizability as seen by potential nominators. One way of ensuring the trustworthiness of your account is attaching some real-world information to your account, including the display name, email, website, etc.

#### Set basic information

Go on the [polkadot.js app](https://subexp.uomi.ai), connect your validator wallet (created as first step in [Spin up a validator](spin-up-a-validator.md)).

Go to **Developer > extrinsics.**

Select **your validator account** and **identity > setIdentity** as extrinsic type

The default info are:

| Name    | data                                           |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Display | Name displayed on-chain when validating blocks |
| Legal   | Legal name                                     |
| Web     | Website                                        |
| Riot    | Element username                               |
| Email   | E-mail address                                 |
| Image   | Validator image                                |
| Twitter | Twitter link/username                          |

You don't need to fill up everything, just leave as "None" whatever you don't want to share.

When you chose something to add, click "None" and select "Raw", write the information

Then click sign **Sumbit transaction** and send

#### Custom information

By clicking "Add new item" you can add custom information (up to 100 custom information), filling up firstly the name, then the data
